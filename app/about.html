Astrel is a native Haitian who knows what it means to grow up on the streets and in the slums. Through the help of a missionary and a small church in Cite Soleil, as a boy he found hope and a new life. Now 55 years later, his dream has come true to bring hope to others.<div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Astrel founded GSF and began a school inside the church that he now pastors. The school began with just 1,500 students from day one because of the great need in Cite Soleil. In 1998 the school, now known as Good Samaritan Institute for Boys and Girls, was moved to another facility. This facility is located on a vacant lot where Astrel used to sleep when he was a boy on the streets. His vision for this lot is unfolding as he wants to build several buildings containing training facilities for a trade school as well as several classrooms to host a primary and secondary school.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>In 2002, GSF began a Christmas Feast for children. This project feeds over 5,000 children each year as well as providing them each with a bag of toys and school supplies. This began after Vincent asked a small child what she wanted for Christmas. He was shocked by her response, "All I want is a big bowl of rice, beans and chicken."  He realized that too many children go to sleep hungry every day in Haiti.</div><div>”</div></div>

                        <div class="card-block">Astrel Vincent's Personal Testimony: "At 10 years of age I began to see that Jesus was the only hope for my family. Born in 1958 to Cap Haitian with no home and little or no food in my stomach, I traveled to Port-au-Prince in search of a father who had left behind a family of eight. Forced to sleep in an abandoned lot in Cite Soleil and wander the crowded streets it all seemed so hopeless. But God was there in a suburbs of Cite Soleil where through a native pastor and an American teacher, His love reached out to me, gave me hope and a new life. He made a way for me to attend Bible school for close to 5 years as I continued to be raised up within the local church. "<div><br></div><div><br></div><div>"I grew in stature and advances from Sunday school teacher to youth Minister to Assistant Pastor. After 15 years serving in the local church and 2 years prior to my pastor’s death, I was set in as pastor of the Cite Soleil church. At my Pastor’s death I became the overseer of 5 additional churches and founded 3 more on my own. Today, I am apostle over 9 churches in the island and have founded the Good Samaritan School, education over 1500 children. "</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>"The vacant lot I slept in over 20 years ago, I now own and it is the central location of the ministry that God has entrusted to me. I was blessed for a short period of time to attend Bible College in Tennessee. But, God needed me more in Haiti. The vision the Lord has given us for our ministry is multifaceted. We truly want to minister to the SPIRIT, SOUL and BODY. Bringing our people to the saving knowledge of Jesus Christ, raising them up in the fullness of the stature of our Lord and the sending them forth to spread the Good News. "</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>"With the help of the Lord we also want to be a part of God’s plan to change Haiti. As people are won to the Lord and their lives are changed we believe new life will be given to Haiti. We want to train up people in the area of academic and professional skills as well. We are raising up the people of Haiti to be doers of the word, supporters of the church, pillars of the community and living the abundant life through the power of Jesus Christ. Together with the help of God, we carry the burden, attempting to pour in the oil and the wine to a dying world, hence the Good Samaritan Foundation of Haiti. "</div></div>
